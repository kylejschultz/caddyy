## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- npm/yarn

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd caddyy
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -e .
   
   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Start development servers**:
   ```bash
   ./dev.sh
   ```

The `dev.sh` script will:

```

**Frontend**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Serves on http://localhost:3000
```

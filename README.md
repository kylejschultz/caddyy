# Caddyy

> A Modern Media Management Solution

## Overview

Caddyy is a media automation application that simplifies the process of fetching and organizing media content. Designed as a simple-to-use alternative to Radarr/Sonarr.

### Key Features (Planned)

- üé¨ **Unified Media Management**: Movies and TV shows 
- üîç **Direct Indexer Integration**: Built-in Newznab-compatible indexer support
- üì° **TMDB Integration**: Automatic metadata fetching and organization
- ‚¨áÔ∏è **SABnzbd Integration**: Seamless download management
- üéØ **Simple Deployment**: Single Docker container with web UI configuration
- üöÄ **Modern Stack**: FastAPI backend + React frontend

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: Modern, async Python web framework
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM with SQLite
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings
- **HTTPX**: Async HTTP client for external APIs

### Frontend
- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **React Query**: Server state management

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- npm/yarn

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd caddyy
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -e .
   
   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Start development servers**:
   ```bash
   ./dev.sh
   ```

The `dev.sh` script will:
- Start the FastAPI backend on `http://localhost:8000`
- Start the Vite frontend dev server on `http://localhost:3000`
- Provide hot-reload for both frontend and backend changes
- Display health status and useful URLs

### Manual Development

If you prefer to run services separately:

**Backend**:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -m backend.main
# Serves on http://localhost:8000
# API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

**Frontend**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Serves on http://localhost:3000
```

**Production Build**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# Builds to ../backend/static/
```
